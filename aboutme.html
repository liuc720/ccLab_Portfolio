        <p>Hi! I'm Zihan (Candy) Liu, a multimedia artist and designer passionate about creativity and storytelling. 
            My pronoun is she/her. I'm curently a sophomore student majoring in Design and Technology at Parsons School of Design. I'm a multi-disciplinary artist with a passion for trying new things, discovering and observing the little details around me! My experience with different education systems and living in many places has made me a global citizen, interested in the world's various cultural backgrounds and more willing to step out of my comfort zone to learn new things.</p>
