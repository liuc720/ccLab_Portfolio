Travel Quiz – Where Should You Go Next?

🎒✨ A community-centered interactive quiz built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to help travelers discover their ideal travel destination based on their preferences, personality, and trip conditions.

🌍 Project Overview

This project was created as part of my Creative Computing Lab coursework. The goal was to build a tool or quiz that centers a specific group. I chose to focus on **travelers**, especially those who are unsure where to go next and want a bit of fun inspiration to help them decide.

The quiz presents a sequence of 8 questions that reflect different aspects of one’s travel style—from preferred climate and budget to travel companions and destination vibe. Based on the user’s answers, the tool uses a weighted scoring algorithm to recommend a destination from a curated list of 15 locations around the world.


🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Target Audience

This quiz is designed for:

- Aspiring and experienced travelers
- People looking for inspiration for their next trip
- Those who enjoy interactive experiences that reflect their personal preferences
- Anyone curious about what destination fits their vibe!


💡 Design & Concept

- The visual style is playful and modern, using flat-style illustrations and clean layout.
- The recommendation logic ensures fairness: each destination is mapped thoughtfully across multiple questions to avoid over-recommendation of popular cities (like Tokyo).
- All answers are scored using weighted logic to reflect the importance of key questions (e.g. preference for nature vs. city, budget, climate).


🛠️ Technical Features

- Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Uses event-driven UI logic with DOM manipulation
- Weighted scoring system across 8 questions
- Responsive and mobile-friendly layout
- Stores quiz logic locally (no backend required)
- Structured folder system with separate `images/`, `css/`, and project subfolder
